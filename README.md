This is a mirror of the main [Branch Metrics iOS SDK repository](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/ios-branch-deep-linking-attribution)
for use only with Swift Package Manager. It removes binaries and all commit
history before release [0.35.0](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/ios-branch-deep-linking-attribution/releases/0.35.0),
the first release to support SPM. This greatly improves performance when using
SPM. Releases to the main repo are automatically replicated here with each
tag.

This is for use only with Swift Package Manager. Please use the main repo for
any other purpose.

**Note:** This repo was previously `BranchMetrics/ios-spm`. The old URL will
still work due to redirection. Please use
`https://github.com/BranchMetrics/ios-branch-sdk-spm` when installing in new
projects and update the old URL when convenient.

See https://help.branch.io/developers-hub/docs/ios-sdk-overview for full
documentation of the Branch iOS SDK.
