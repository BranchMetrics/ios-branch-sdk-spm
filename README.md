# Swift Package Manager repository for iOS

_Work in progress_

This is a mirror of the main [iOS repository](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/ios-branch-deep-linking-attribution)
for use only with Swift Package Manager. It removes binaries and all commit
history before release [0.35.0](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/ios-branch-deep-linking-attribution/releases/0.35.0),
the first release to support SPM. This greatly improves performance when using
SPM. Releases to the main repo are automatically replicated here with each
tag.

This is for use only with Swift Package Manager. Please use the main repo for
any other purpose.

See https://help.branch.io/developers-hub/docs/ios-sdk-overview for full
documentation of the Branch iOS SDK.
